This project aims to simulate fire detection in space in near real time leveraging "Space 2.0" methods and consists of two parts: 
## The Model : containing a machine learning model that performs the inference written in python using Tensorflow
## The Dashboard :a web written in NextJs and displays the metrics from the models inference 

There are readme files in the folders describing how to project
General requirements for this project are
- Javascript
- NodeJS
- Tensor Flow
